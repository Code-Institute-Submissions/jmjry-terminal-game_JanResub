# Terminal Game

## What is Terminal Game?

NAME is a text-based adventure game. Your character (randomised upon starting the game) is going to rob a bank. Every decision you make has consequences and you'll need to use logic to navigate safely through the security and open the bank vault to win.

## Planning process:

* In my initial design, I branched out the logic and paths a user could follow to either win the game or lose the game. The flow demonstrated when a user will make choices, face challenges and either win or lose.

* The original content for the game was drafted in a google doc to ensure spelling, punctuation and grammar were accurate. You can [view the google doc here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lgPP9bIV8M1vxFhaoXsuXvOUJz8m8mP5Ni0mhJJc1eQ/edit?usp=sharing)

### Changes to my planning process: 

* My original design path remains however it became apparent that the game could be navigated to completion very quickly. For this reason, I decided to add additional paths to each of the routes - those changes can be seen here.
* As the design path changed additional content was required to furfill this.

## Technologies: 

For this project I will be using Python, HTML, CSS and some JavaScript.

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs: 
* [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/) was the version control used.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) is the repository used for project codes to be pushed from GitPod.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create wireframes during the design process of this project.

## Features 

### Current features:

* F1 - Loading the game 

* F2 - Character generator 

* F3 - Starting the game 

* F4 - First decision 

* F5 - Random number generator 

* F6 - Keypad loop puzzle 

* F7 - Word input 

* F8 - 1st Maths Puzzle 

* F9 - 2nd Maths Puzzle 

* F10 - Key date puzzle 

### Features which could be implemented in the future:

* F11 - Easter Egg

* F12 - User Login
I'd like to add the availbility for a user to create an account for the game. This would require a user to register a username and password which will then be stored in a google sheet and linked via an API. With this added, it would give the game scope to enhance the user experience and furthering the way users interact with the game.

## Testing 

Testing was undertaken at the start, during and after finishing my project. To complete my testing I used the [Google Chrome DevTool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/), a spreadsheet to track tests, validators (as seen below) and reviews by peers (as seen in the credits).

### Feature testing 
* Each feature was tested for responsiveness on desktop, tablet and mobile. If the feature responded correctly then it was marked green on my spreadsheet.
* All features that had links were tested to ensure the link would work when a user click on it. All of the links passed the test and was marked green.
* All form fields were tested to ensure the correct information was submitted. The form fields passed the test and was marked green. 

### Validator testing 

* HTML 
  * Testing results below [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html) 
  
 * CSS
   * No erros were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)  
   
 * JavaScript

* PEP8 
 * No major errors were found when passing through the [PEP8 Online Check] (http://pep8online.com)

 ### Accessibility testing 
 
 * I used [WAVE] to test the accessibility of  
 
 * Lighthouse Testing
 
  * 

* Feature Testing 

 * Each individual feature was tested with the results recorded on a spreadsheet. The test includes responsiveness checks and that the feature completes the intended task.

### Content 

* For interesting maths puzzles I used [CUE MATH](https://www.cuemath.com/learn/fun-maths-questions/) and selected a few of their puzzles for my game.

### Code 

* As a go to reasource hub I used [W3S Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp).
* To create my responsive picture examples I used [ami.responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is).
* When stuck on a development issue, I checked [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to see if other developers had the same problems.

### Acknowledgments 

* I'd like to thank Brian Macharia for providing feedback, ideas and suggestions for improving my site.
