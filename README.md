## Testing 

Testing was undertaken at the start, during and after finishing my project. To complete my testing I used the [Google Chrome DevTool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/), a spreadsheet to track tests, validators (as seen below) and reviews by peers (as seen in the credits).

### Feature testing 
* Each feature was tested for responsiveness on desktop, tablet and mobile. If the feature responded correctly then it was marked green on my spreadsheet.
* All features that had links were tested to ensure the link would work when a user click on it. All of the links passed the test and was marked green.
* All form fields were tested to ensure the correct information was submitted. The form fields passed the test and was marked green. 

### Validator testing 

* HTML 
  * Testing results below [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fcode-institute-org.github.io%2Flove-running-2.0%2Findex.html) 
  
 * CSS
   * No erros were found when passing through the official [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)  
   
 * JavaScript

 ### Accessibility testing 
 
 * I used [WAVE] to test the accessibility of Country Royale. 
 
 * Lighthouse Testing
 
  * Using the lighthouse testing available with the google devtool Country Royale received a performance score of 86. To improve this, I should upload all of my images into an online storage and call upon the url instead of transfering this data directly. 

* Feature Testing 

 * Each individual feature was tested with the results recorded on a spreadsheet. The test includes responsiveness checks and that the feature completes the intended task.
